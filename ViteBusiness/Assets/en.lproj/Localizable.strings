Required quota for sending a transaction = the basic quota (request) + quota (the attached text data), quota required to accept a transaction = the basic quota (response). This quota-based resource configuration protocol allows users to obtain higher resource quotas in two ways: </p><p style=\"font-PingFangSC-Regular;font-size:11;color:#3E4A59\">a.Staking VITE to obtain quota</p><p style=\"font-PingFangSC-Regular;font-size:11;color:#3E4A59\">b.Running PoW</p><p style=\"font-PingFangSC-Regular;font-size:11;color:#3E4A59\">Unit of Quota: UTPS, Unit of Transaction per Second.</p><h1 style=\"font-PingFangSC-Medium;font-size:12;color:#24272B\">What is Staking?</h1><p style=\"font-PingFangSC-Regular;font-size:11;color:#3E4A59\">In the Vite system, the user can stake VITE to obtain a certain amount of quota. The minimum value for staking is 1000 VITE, and there is no maximum limit; meanwhile, Vite system also supports that the A-address stakes a part of the VITE and allocates the obtained quota to the B address. When users apply to stake, VITE will be sent to the smart contract address instead of another user, and only the user who applies for staking has access to manage the staking amount.</p><h1 style=\"font-PingFangSC-Medium;font-size:12;color:#24272B\">What is PoW?</h1><p style=\"font-PingFangSC-Regular;font-size:11;color:#3E4A59\">Proof of Work (PoW), is a protocol to confirm that you have done a certain amount of work, and is also an economic measure to deter DDoS attacks and other service abuse. It requires the initiator to conduct a certain amount of computing, which means that it may take some time for the computer. In the Vite system, users can obtain a free quota by running the PoW, and also can send a transaction without any annotated information through obtained quota.</p>";
